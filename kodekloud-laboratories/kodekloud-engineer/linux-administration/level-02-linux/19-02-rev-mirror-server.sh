There is a static website running in Stratos Datacenter. 
They have already configured the app servers and code is 
already deployed there. To make it work properly, they 
need to configure server. There are number of 
options for that, but team has decided to go with 
HAproxy. 

FYI, apache is running on port 3001 on all 
app servers. Complete this task as per below details.

a. Install and configure HAproxy on server using yum 
only and make sure all app servers are added to 
HAproxy load balancer. HAproxy must serve on default 
http port (Note: Please do not remove stats socket 
/var/lib/haproxy/stats entry from haproxy default 
config.).

b. Once done, you can access the website using 
StaticApp button on the top bar.
